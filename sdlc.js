// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const AnalysisOfRequirements = "This involves communication with stakeholders, users, and other relevant parties to define what the software should accomplish."
const Design = "During this phase, the system architecture and design are created. This includes defining the software's structure, components, and how they will interact with each other."
const Implementation = "Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications. This is where the software is built and programmed."
const Testing_Integration = "After coding, thorough testing is performed to ensure that the software functions correctly and meets the specified requirements. This can include unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing."
const Maintain = "After deployment, the software requires ongoing maintenance and support. This involves addressing bugs, making updates, and providing user support."
